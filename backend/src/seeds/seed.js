      "two cofounders, both worked in this space for 5+ years. our lead dev built similar stuff at her last company",
      "biggest risk is probably timing. we're launching a beta with 500 users first to validate before going all in",
      "yeah we designed it to scale from day one. each piece runs independently so we can throw more resources at whatever needs it",
      "we ran a 3 month beta with about 200 users. retention was solid and the feedback has been really positive",
      "we have a few LOIs from companies and one partnership thats close to being finalized",
      "tested a few price points with beta users. $29/mo hit the sweet spot, about a third of testers converted",
      "most of it goes to eng and product. maybe 25% to marketing, rest is ops and hiring",
      "right now about 12k/month with 4 people. after funding probably 30-35k with a bigger team",
      "we checked with a lawyer and we're good in the US and EU. some countries might need extra paperwork later",
      "building community features into the product. users who engage with those stick around way longer from what we've seen",
      "yeah the math works. CAC goes down significantly at scale and LTV keeps growing as we add features",
